## ec2wrap 

Yet another wrapper to manage your EC2 instances. Before starting to tinker with libraries such as _boto_ or _fog_, I decided to give EC2 tools a try and boost my bash skills on the way.

My workflow with EC2 it's pretty straightforward. I just create instances using either a public AMI or an AWS AMI, running a specific service such as Memcache,PostgreSQL or Chef server. Unit testing is present as an example. I used [roundup](https://github.com/bmizerany/roundup), but I barely completed four tests, although I would like to have one test for each of the functions I have.  Do not forget to set up you enviroment variables before running the script.

### Usage

```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh
usage: ec2wrap.sh [OPTIONS] cmd
      -h,--help                         Show this menu.
      -a,--alias                        Set alias for an instance.
      -g,--group                        Security group (default).
      -k,--keypair                      Keypair.
      -m,--ami                          Bootstrap selected AMI.
      -n,--multiple-instances           Clone 'n' times the same configuration.
      -z,--zone                         Availability zone for the instance.
      -t,--instance-type                Instace type.
      -i,--id                           Instance ID.
      aliases                           List aliases for instances.
      clone                             Clone instance using tags.
      create                            Create a new instance.
      kill                              Terminate an instance.
      list                              List instances.
      start                             Start an instance.
      stop                              Stop an instance.
      update                            Run manual update.
```

If you create a new instance, assign an alias, next time just clone the alias

```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh  create -m  ami-6996931d -g default  -k mykeypair.pem -t t1.micro -z eu-west-1a  --alias=centos62
```

Clone your instance using the above alias
```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh clone -a centos62
``` 
It's also possible to clone and modify some of the attributes, such as group, zone or instance type. 
```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh clone -a centos62 -t m1.small
```

You might need to create several instances of the same alias, in the next example I launch three instances using the 
**memcache** alias.

```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh clone -a memcache -n 3
```
If you are familiar with EC2, you already know that when starting or stopping instances your public dns changes. I managed to add a host definition to the  _/.ssh/config_ using the instance ID. Every time you start the instance the file is updated with the new public dns. 

```bash
$ ec2wrap.sh start -i i-cb80ea83 
```
Log in your instance:
```bash
ssh i-cb80ea83

```
